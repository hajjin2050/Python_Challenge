# Solving Exponential Equations With Logarithms

#Create a function that takes a number `a` and finds the missing exponent `x` so that `a` raised to the power of `x` is equal to `b`.

## Examples

- `solve_for_exp(4, 1024)` ➞ 5
- `solve_for_exp(2, 1024)` ➞ 10
- `solve_for_exp(9, 3486784401)` ➞ 10

## Notes

- `a` is raised to the power of what in order to equal `b`?
